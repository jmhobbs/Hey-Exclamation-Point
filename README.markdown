# What is Hey! #

Hey is a very basic reminders system written in Python.

# Why? #

Because it is something I wanted to write.

I wanted something with the ability to give me reminders in with really weird parameters and exceptions.

I also want it to be flexible and cross-platform.

# Alternatives? #

I couldn't find any ones I love.  Here are some I did find, feel free to suggest additions. This is not an endorsement for any of these, just a handy reference table.
